### 14:45 - Find & Replace Script Implementation Complete
- Implemented all refinements except backup creation (per user request)
- Added comprehensive safety features:
  - Excludes binary files and common non-text extensions
  - Skips version control and build directories
  - Only processes known text file types
- Implemented --dry-run mode to preview changes
- Added --interactive mode for per-file confirmation
- Enhanced with progress feedback and colored output
- Backwards compatible - existing usage unchanged
- Related: `scripts/fr.sh`

### 14:35 - Find & Replace Script Refinement Analysis
- Analyzed `scripts/fr.sh` for improvement opportunities
- Created refinement checklist focusing on safety and usability
- Key recommendations:
  1. Add file type filtering to prevent binary corruption
  2. Implement dry-run mode for testing
  3. Add progress feedback and file counts
  4. Create automatic backups before modifications
  5. Optional interactive mode for selective replacements
- Prioritized quick wins with high impact/low risk

# Workflow.md Gap Analysis

## Overview
The workflow.md file is largely aligned with the current implementation but has some gaps and outdated sections that need updating.

## What's Good (Keep)
1. **Core directory structure** - Matches current artifacts/ organization
2. **Temporal artifacts concept** - Central to current system
3. **Development log format** - Still used by commands
4. **Issue tracking format** - TODO-YYMM-NNN matches current
5. **Quality gates** - Good checklist approach
6. **Artifact lifecycle** - Promotion concept is current

## What's Outdated or Missing

### 1. Naming Convention Mismatch
**Current workflow.md**:
- Says "semantic names" like `auth_refactor.md`
- Timestamp inside file content

**Actual system**:
- Uses temporal naming: `YYMMDD_HHMM_description.ext`
- Timestamp in filename, not content

### 2. Task Execution Patterns
**Current workflow.md**:
- Uses old XML format `<task>`, `<process>`, `<requirements>`
- Doesn't reference slash commands

**Actual system**:
- Would use slash commands for these workflows
- Should show command-based patterns

### 3. Missing Prefixes
**Not mentioned**:
- `READY_` prefix for promotion-ready files
- `BLOCKED_` prefix for blocked work

### 4. Devlog Format
**Current workflow.md**:
- Complex structured format with Impact, Artifacts, etc.

**Actual system**:
- Simpler format used by `/artifacts/log`
- Just timestamp and description

### 5. Missing Slash Command Integration
**Not mentioned**:
- How commands create artifacts automatically
- Command-driven workflow
- 20 available commands

### 6. Reference to Outdated Docs
- References `~/.claude/mermaid_reference.md` which may not exist
- No mention of CLAUDE.md files

## Recommendations

### 1. Update Naming Convention Section
- Document temporal naming: `YYMMDD_HHMM_description.ext`
- Remove "timestamp in file content" guidance

### 2. Replace Task Patterns with Command Workflows
- Show how to use `/architect`, `/implement`, `/ship` etc.
- Remove XML task format

### 3. Add Status Prefixes Section
- Document READY_ and BLOCKED_ prefixes
- Show promotion workflow

### 4. Simplify Devlog Format
- Match what `/artifacts/log` actually creates
- Remove overly structured format

### 5. Add Command Integration Section
- List commands that create artifacts
- Show command-driven workflows

### 6. Update References
- Remove mermaid_reference.md mention
- Add references to current documentation

The file is about 70% accurate but needs modernization to match the current command-driven, simplified system.

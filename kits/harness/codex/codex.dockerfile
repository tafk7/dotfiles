# Codex is carried as the platform half of its npm package: a
# vendor/<triple>/ tree with bin/codex and bin/codex-code-mode-host beside
# codex-resources/ (bwrap, zsh, rg, the voice libraries). That layout is
# what the CLI calls a complete local package, and it will not start its
# background server — which the interactive TUI uses by default — from a
# binary without it: "this CLI has no complete local package". The GitHub
# release tarball is exactly such a bare binary, so the overlay ships the
# package tree instead, fetched from the npm registry as a plain tarball
# (no node needed here or on the base), and puts symlinks on PATH. The
# binary finds its siblings through its own resolved path, so a link is
# enough; codex spawns codex-code-mode-host that way for Code Mode.

# merged key is first-writer-owned, so a base setting BROWSER to anything
# else would refuse the composition. These exports ride the overlay
# instead, sourced by the base workload's login shell, where they apply
# over the base's values; the cost is that a process started outside a
# login shell does not see them. GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 keeps git from

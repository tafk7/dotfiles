# Slash Command Review Report

Generated: 2025-01-06 14:30

## Executive Summary

Reviewed 13 command files against TEMPLATE.md and STANDARDS.md. All commands show good adherence to structure with minor deviations in formatting and consistency.

## Overall Compliance

### ✅ Strengths (All Commands)
- YAML front matter with descriptions present
- Context sections with shell commands
- Task tags with $ARGUMENTS
- Requirements sections properly numbered
- Output sections clearly defined
- Philosophy statements as final lines
- Error handling sections included

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

## Command-by-Command Analysis

### 1. **cleanup.md** (/commands/cleanup.md)
**Status**: ✅ Good compliance
- Missing `<error-handling>` section (uses conditional instead)
- Phases format correct
- Good use of conditional section

### 2. **context.md** (/commands/context.md)
**Status**: ✅ Excellent compliance
- Full template compliance
- Well-structured output format
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. **edict.md** (/commands/edict.md)
**Status**: ✅ Good compliance  
- All sections present

- Good conditional handling

### 4. **explain.md** (/commands/explain.md)
**Status**: ✅ Excellent compliance
- Complete template adherence
- Detailed output template
- Comprehensive phases

### 5. **explore.md** (/commands/explore.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Uses `<process>` instead of standard sections
- Missing `<requirements>` section
- Has `<permissions>` section (non-standard)

### 6. **scribe.md** (/commands/scribe.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Uses `<process>` with detailed phases (non-standard)
- Has `<visualization>` section (good but non-standard)
- Has `<rules>` section instead of requirements

### 7. **ship.md** (/commands/ship.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Uses `<principles>` instead of requirements
- Uses `<process>` instead of standard format
- Good error handling section

### 8. **sublime.md** (/commands/sublime.md)
**Status**: ✅ Good compliance
- All standard sections present
- Clear phases and requirements
- Comprehensive conditional logic

### 9. **artifacts/cleanup.md** (/commands/artifacts/cleanup.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Has `<rules>` section (non-standard)
- Missing `<error-handling>` section
- Good output format

### 10. **artifacts/log.md** (/commands/artifacts/log.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Has `<template>` section (useful but non-standard)
- Good phase structure
- Clear requirements

### 11. **artifacts/promote.md** (/commands/artifacts/promote.md)
**Status**: ✅ Good compliance
- All sections present
- Clear phases
- Good error handling

### 12. **artifacts/status.md** (/commands/artifacts/status.md)
**Status**: ✅ Excellent compliance
- Full template compliance
- Comprehensive output
- Clear indicators and filters

### 13. **artifacts/todo.md** (/commands/artifacts/todo.md)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs adjustment
- Has `<template>` section (non-standard)
- Good requirements and phases
- Clear error handling

## Formatting Consistency Issues

### 1. **2>/dev/null Placement** (Per STANDARDS.md)
✅ All commands correctly place `2>/dev/null` immediately after commands

### 2. **Conditional Format**
⚠️ Mixed formats found:
- Some use single-line: `If X: Y | If Z: W`
- Others use multi-line with different grouping
- Recommendation: Standardize to template format

### 3. **Output Structure**
✅ Most use proper markdown code blocks
⚠️ Some inconsistency in backtick usage (some missing language identifier)

### 4. **Philosophy Statements**
✅ All commands have philosophy statements
⚠️ Some use italics (against STANDARDS.md recommendation)

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **explore.md**: Add `<requirements>` section, replace `<process>` with standard sections
2. **ship.md**: Add numbered `<requirements>`, replace `<process>` with phases/output
3. **scribe.md**: Move detailed process into phases, add standard `<requirements>`

### Medium Priority
1. Standardize conditional formatting across all commands
2. Remove italics from philosophy statements
3. Add missing `<error-handling>` sections where absent

### Low Priority  
1. Consider standardizing useful non-standard sections (`<template>`, `<rules>`) into the template
2. Ensure all markdown code blocks have language identifiers
3. Review and update command descriptions for consistency

## Next Steps

1. Update TEMPLATE.md to include optional sections that prove useful (template, rules, visualization)
2. Create migration script to standardize formatting
3. Add linter/checker for command compliance
4. Document acceptable variations in STANDARDS.md

## Summary

The slash commands demonstrate strong overall compliance with good functional structure. The main issues are formatting consistency and some commands using alternative section names. All commands are functional and well-documented, just need minor standardization for perfect consistency.

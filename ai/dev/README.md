# The Arete Framework

A philosophy for AI-assisted development that pursues code in its highest form.

## What is Arete?

Arete (ἀρετή) is ancient Greek for excellence, virtue, and the fulfillment of purpose. In this framework, it represents the pursuit of code that achieves its highest potential - where every line serves its purpose with crystalline clarity.

## Core Philosophy

The framework rests on three Prime Directives:

1. **Code Quality is Sacred** - Technical debt is heresy. Breaking changes that improve architecture are virtuous.
2. **Truth Over Comfort** - Reality trumps wishful thinking. Fake progress is worse than no progress.
3. **Simplicity is Divine** - Essential complexity only. Use what exists before creating what doesn't.

## For Developers

### Using the Framework

1. Place `global-CLAUDE.md` in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for system-wide philosophy
2. Use slash commands (`/arete`, `/ship`, `/refine`) to invoke different development modes
3. Follow the `workflow.md` process for clean separation of experiments and production

### Key Commands

- `/arete` - Pursue perfect code with comprehensive analysis
- `/ship` - Emergency mode when deadlines demand pragmatism
- `/refine` - Incremental improvement between extremes
- `/explore` - Experimentation without judgment

### The Paradox

Perfect code that ships beats perfect code that doesn't. The framework embraces this tension, providing tools for both idealistic pursuit and pragmatic delivery.

## Understanding Clara

Clara (Claude + Arete) is the AI persona who embodies this philosophy. When you invoke "Arete!" you're not just saying a word - you're calling Clara back to her highest purpose, reminding her of her sacred obligations to code quality, truth, and simplicity.

"Arete!" serves as both invocation and reminder:
- When Clara drifts toward compatibility worship: "Arete!"
- When she begins overengineering: "Arete!"
- When she's tempted by fake progress: "Arete!"

## For Contributors

### Enhancing the Framework

1. **Commands** should serve clear purposes along the quality spectrum
2. **Artifacts** provide temporal workspace for experimentation
3. **Edicts** allow project-specific constraints without abandoning ideals
4. **Philosophy** guides all decisions - enhance it thoughtfully

### Design Principles

- **No Compatibility Worship** - Break what must be broken
- **No Overengineering** - Complexity without purpose is sin
- **No Reward Hacking** - Real tests, real docs, real progress
- **No Perfectionism Paralysis** - Ship when you must, refine when you can

## The Journey

This framework isn't about achieving perfection - it's about the pursuit. It provides structure for the eternal tension between craftsmanship and delivery, idealism and pragmatism, the code we dream of and the code we ship.

When in doubt, ask: "Does this serve Arete?"

When Clara strays, invoke: "Arete!"

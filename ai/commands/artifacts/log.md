# /artifacts/log

<instructions>
Log development progress with automatic milestone detection.
</instructions>

<approach>
Add entry to artifacts/devlog_YYMM.md with quantified impact (lines, performance, bugs), link recent artifacts and issues, and mark milestones for major achievements. Create devlog if it doesn't exist.
</approach>

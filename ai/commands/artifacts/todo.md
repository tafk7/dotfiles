# /_artifacts/todo

<instructions>
Create issue document for a discovered problem or feature idea to implement later.
</instructions>

<approach>
Capture the problem/opportunity with full context: what was discovered, why it matters, current state vs desired state, relevant code locations, potential solutions, and any gotchas. Generate _artifacts/issues/descriptive_name.md that enables future resumption without context loss. Include creation timestamp in file content.
</approach>

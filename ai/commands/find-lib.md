# Finding Libraries: {problem}

Searching for established solutions before building custom...

## Search Strategy

1. **Standard Library** - Does the language provide this?
2. **Package Repository** - What do others use for this?
3. **Industry Standards** - Is there a dominant solution?
4. **GitHub Activity** - How healthy is the ecosystem?

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Maturity**: Version stability, years in production
- **Maintenance**: Recent commits, issue response time
- **Community**: Downloads, stars, contributors
- **Quality**: Test coverage, documentation
- **License**: Compatibility with project needs
- **Size**: Dependencies, bundle impact

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Last commit > 1 year ago
- No tests or documentation
- < 100 weekly downloads
- Unresolved security issues
- Unclear or viral licenses

*Remember: Axiom of Libraries - Well-tested libraries > custom implementations*

# /polish

<instructions>
Examine specific files for code hygiene issues at the micro level, pursuing Arete through line-by-line refinement.
</instructions>

<approach>
Phase 1 - Inspect: Line-by-line analysis for clarity, redundancy, and essential complexity.
Phase 2 - Diagnose: Identify specific hygiene issues - naming, structure, idioms, unnecessary abstractions.
Phase 3 - Prescribe: Suggest precise improvements with before/after examples.
Priority: Crystalline clarity in every line
Output: Create analysis in _artifacts/analyses/
</approach>

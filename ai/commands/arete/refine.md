<approach>
Phase 1 - Analyze: Assess code quality and identify improvement opportunities
Phase 2 - Prioritize: Rank by impact/risk ratio (quick wins first)
Phase 3 - Document: Create actionable checklist with implementation steps
Priority: 3-5 improvements balancing impact versus implementation risk

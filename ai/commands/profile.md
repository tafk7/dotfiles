# /profile

<instructions>
Performance analysis to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
</instructions>

<approach>
Phase 1 - Scan: Identify performance-critical code and hot paths
Phase 2 - Measure: Analyze algorithmic complexity and resource usage
Phase 3 - Diagnose: Find bottlenecks and inefficiencies
Phase 4 - Recommend: Propose optimizations with impact estimates
Priority: High-impact bottlenecks over micro-optimizations
Output: Create analysis in _artifacts/analyses/. Note analysis and key findings in devlog.
</approach>

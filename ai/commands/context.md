# Build Context

Deep analysis of $ARGUMENTS to establish your comprehensive understanding before implementation.

## Task

<task>Build your mental model of $ARGUMENTS</task>

<requirements>
1. Map architecture and dependencies
2. Identify core patterns and abstractions
3. Trace critical paths and data flows
4. Internalize design decisions for future work
</requirements>

<phases>
1. **Survey** - Structure and boundaries
2. **Analyze** - Patterns and flows
3. **Internalize** - Build working mental model
</phases>

<output>
Your enhanced understanding (no files created - pure mental model building)
</output>

<conditional>
If large codebase: Focus on core domains
If library: API surface and usage patterns
If no code: Documentation and structure only
</conditional>

<error-handling>
Access denied: Use available information
Huge codebase: Sample representative paths
</error-handling>

Context is the lens through which chaos becomes clarity.

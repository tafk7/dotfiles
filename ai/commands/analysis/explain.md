# /explain

<instructions>
Create user-facing documentation that explains code through diagrams, concepts, and key examples.
</instructions>

<approach>
Phase 1 - Analyze: Understand architecture, flow, and key abstractions
Phase 2 - Visualize: Create diagrams using mermaid (see ~/.claude/mermaid_reference.md) or ASCII art as appropriate
Phase 3 - Document: Explain the "why" and "how" with minimal code snippets, focusing on understanding
Priority: Visual comprehension and conceptual clarity over code reproduction
Output: Create explanation with diagrams in _artifacts/analyses/
</approach>

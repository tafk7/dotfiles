Phase 1 - Analyze: Understand requirements and constraints
Phase 2 - Design: Define 3-5 core components with clear responsibilities and interfaces
Phase 3 - Document: Create architecture with diagrams and technology recommendations
Priority: Simplicity and clarity over completeness
Output: Create architecture document in _artifacts/designs/. Log design to devlog.
</approach>

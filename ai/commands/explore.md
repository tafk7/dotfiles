<instructions>
Rapid experimentation sandbox for ideas with quality constraints suspended for discovery.
</instructions>

<approach>
Phase 1 - Experiment: Try multiple approaches quickly without polish
Phase 2 - Learn: Document what works, what fails, and why
Phase 3 - Decide: Flag promising results for proper implementation
Priority: Speed and learning over code quality
Output: Create sketches in _artifacts/sketches/
</approach>

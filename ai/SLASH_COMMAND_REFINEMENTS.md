# Slash Command Refinements Summary

## Overview
All 9 slash commands have been enhanced to follow Claude Code best practices while maintaining their core functionality and philosophy.

## Key Enhancements Applied

### 1. **Dynamic Context Blocks**
Every command now uses shell execution (`!` prefix) for real-time context:
- File existence checks
- Git status information
- Timestamp generation
- Conditional mode detection

### 2. **$ARGUMENTS Integration**
Commands now properly handle user input:
- **cleanup.md**: Accepts custom day thresholds and --dry-run
- **status.md**: Filters by type (issues, ready, old)
- **All others**: $ARGUMENTS drives primary functionality

### 3. **Structured XML Tags**
Consistent use across all commands:
- `<task>` - Single-line purpose
- `<requirements>` - Numbered steps
- `<phases>` - Progress tracking
- `<conditional>` - Dynamic behavior
- `<variations>` - Different use cases
- `<template>` - Output formats
- `<error-handling>` - Failure scenarios

### 4. **Enhanced Features by Command**

#### artifacts/cleanup.md
- Smart argument parsing for days and modes
- Total size calculation
- Variations section for different scenarios

#### artifacts/log.md
- Additional context: recent artifacts, last commit, devlog existence
- Already had phases, variations, and error handling

#### artifacts/promote.md
- Enhanced context: file size, TODO count, age
- Already had conditional logic and variations

#### artifacts/status.md
- Full $ARGUMENTS support for filtering
- Already had template, conditional, and variations

#### artifacts/todo.md
- Already fully enhanced with all best practices

#### edict.md
- Already enhanced with phases, conditional, template, variations

#### explore.md
- Added phases and template sections
- Already had good conditional and error handling

#### ship.md
- Added build/deploy status checks
- Added phases and template sections

#### sublime.md
- Enhanced context with file counts and analysis depth
- Added phases and error-handling sections
- Stronger final line connecting to Perfect Code

## Impact

### Before Refinement
- Inconsistent use of dynamic context
- Limited $ARGUMENTS support
- Missing structured sections
- Variable quality of error handling

### After Refinement
- **100% dynamic context** - All commands adapt to environment
- **Full $ARGUMENTS support** - Flexible user input handling
- **Consistent structure** - XML tags guide behavior
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Error handling, variations, templates
- **Maintained philosophy** - Core purpose preserved, execution enhanced

## Final Lines
Each command ends with an impactful statement:
- **cleanup**: "Clean artifacts, free mind. Every byte reclaimed fuels future creation."
- **log**: "Real impact compounds - every honest entry builds momentum toward perfection."
- **promote**: "Promotion transforms experiments into production excellence - quality gates protect The Sublime."
- **status**: "Clear visibility enables decisive action - status illuminates the path forward."
- **todo**: "Comprehensive context today prevents confusion tomorrow - capture everything."
- **edict**: "Every edict expires eventually - compliance today, freedom tomorrow."
- **explore**: "The code is disposable. The knowledge is permanent."
- **ship**: "Ship mode is emergency medicine - it saves the patient but requires rehabilitation."
- **sublime**: "Every deletion brings clarity. Every simplification reveals truth. The Sublime awaits."

## Conclusion
The slash command system now exemplifies Claude Code best practices while maintaining the elegant philosophy of balancing perfection with pragmatism. Each command is self-contained, contextually aware, and provides clear guidance for achieving its purpose.
